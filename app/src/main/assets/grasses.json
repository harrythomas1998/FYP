      "care": "Garden care: These plants are potted up (using a suitable aquatic compost) into 1-litre aquatic pots. These pots are made of a fine mesh, which allows water to circulate through the compost, providing the plants with both oxygen and nutrients. If you are using them as a aquatic plant, they can be placed straight into the pond, however they will preform better if planted out sooner rather than later. To enhance flowering divide congested clumps every three to five years."
